# Material Components - Android Theming

Material Theming refers to the customization of your Material Design app to reflect your productâ€™s brand

## Color system

The Material Design color system uses an organized approach to applying color to your UI. In this system, two theme colors are selected to express different parts of a UI: a primary color and a secondary color. Material components use these theme colors and their variations to style their individual backgrounds, text, and more.

### Usage
```xml
<style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.MaterialComponents.Light.NoActionBar">
</style>
``
